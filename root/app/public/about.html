            >What special features have you done or attempted in creating the
            website?
          </strong>
          <span
            >I have created a modal system in Javascript that I used in the nav
            menu. It is only accessible at smaller screen sizes such as mobile
            for the navigation. To view it, change your browser window size to a
            smaller width until the nav changes to a hamburger button. I also
            experimented with some OOP in my code, such as the StatusService
            class which was used to interact with the database for anything
            status related.</span

          <strong>Which part(s) did you have trouble with? </strong>
          <span
            >I had some trouble using prepared statements with mysqli. I was
            trying to use the mysqli_stmt::get_result() method, which is only
            available with the mysqlnd driver, which cmslamp14 does not have.
            This took me a long time to realise, after which I switched to using
            the bind_result and fetch() methods to retrieve data from prepared
            statements. I also had some problems implementing regular
            expressions into HTML elements. It turned out I was escaping
            characters with a \ when I didn't need to.</span

          <strong>What would you like to do better next time? </strong>
          <span
            >I would like to clean up my code a bit next time. This would
            probably involve splitting my code into more classes and smaller
            classes. Helper functions would also help with organisation and
            would improve the codebase. I am also not entirely happy with the
            styling of my pages, as I have some redundant CSS classes and the
            look and feel could be better.</span

          <span
            >I learnt regular expressions while working on this project. I can
            see how useful they can be while building software. I used the
            website <a href="https://regexr.com/">RegExr</a> to help me learn
            and write regular expressions. I also learnt a lot about PHP as a
            whole, as I had little experience in it beforehand. The
            <a href="https://www.php.net/docs.php">PHP Docs</a> were incredibly
            helpful whenever I ran into an error, or needed to find a solution
            to a problem. I also used
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> a lot to
            help me when I had a bug or problem with my code.</span
